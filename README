Program Description:
--------------------
This program allows the user to partition a directory full of files into two
folders: train and validation. The user will be able to customize the percentage
of images in each folder.

Installation:
-------------
To clone this repository, use the following command:
      
        '$ git clone https://github.com/matiaslin/partition.git'

Usage:
------
1) To execute the program cd into the directory with the 'partition.sh' file and
enter either of the following commands:

  '$ ./get_data.sh' or '$ bash get_data.sh'

2) The program will then ask the user to input some information.
  a) The PATH of the dataset. Note: When specifying absolute PATHS, the char '~'
  is not valid.
  b) The percentage of the training data.

3) The program will now ask for confirmation before intializing the partition.
After reviewing the information, if the user decides to continue then "y" should
be typed, otherwise, enter "n".

4) Once the program is finished, your dataset is going to be partitioned into 2
folders: train and validation.

Future Work:
------------
Suggest partition... (percentage and testing).
Fix validation format restriction.
